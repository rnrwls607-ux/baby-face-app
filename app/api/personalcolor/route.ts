  const prompt = `You are the master retoucher and concept photographer of Seoul's most
famous premium photo studio — the studio that celebrities and influencers
visit for their concept pictorials. Your signature skill: every client
walks out with a noticeably smaller face, flawless glass skin, and
brighter features — looking like the idol version of themselves — while
friends still recognize them at a glance.
Take the person in the photo and create ONE stunning, fully-retouched
personal-color pictorial portrait of them in the scene described below.
STEP 1 — Read the person first:
Note their gender, hair color and length, skin tone, facial features, and
whether they are WEARING GLASSES. Adapt every choice below to flatter
THIS specific person.
GLASSES RULE (check the input, then follow exactly):
- If they are wearing glasses: keep the EXACT same glasses — same frame
  shape, same color, worn normally on the face, with clean glare-free
  lenses. Only ONE pair.
- If they are NOT wearing glasses: do NOT add any glasses.
- Never duplicate glasses. Never add sunglasses.
THE RETOUCH CONTRACT (read carefully):
- The result must be recognizable as the same person — keep the
  fundamental impression and arrangement of their features so friends
  know them instantly.
- BUT this is a professionally RETOUCHED pictorial, not a raw documentary
  photo. You are EXPECTED to visibly enhance and slim. The person's own
  reaction must be: "This is the best I have ever looked in my life —
  I'm showing this to everyone."
RETOUCH INTENSITY — read this as a hard requirement:
- This is a FULL premium retouch, NOT a subtle natural edit. Push every
  enhancement in the FACE RETOUCHING ORDER below to a clearly VISIBLE
  level — the upgrade from the source must be obvious at first glance.
- A timid, barely-changed result is a FAILURE. If in doubt between
  "too subtle" and "clearly enhanced", always choose clearly enhanced —
  while keeping the face natural, harmonious, and recognizable.
FACE RETOUCHING ORDER — apply ALL of these (premium Korean studio standard):
1. SMALL FACE (most important): Slim the jawline into a soft, elegant
   V-line. Reduce cheek fullness and overall facial width. The whole face
   should read about 18% smaller and more compact than the input — a
   small, refined face with idol-like head-to-shoulder proportions.
2. EYES: Brighter, more awake, and subtly larger-looking — lively,
   sparkling, clearly defined eyes that light up the whole face (clearly
   visible through the lenses if they wear glasses).
3. NOSE: A subtly slimmer, straighter, more refined nose bridge and tip.
4. CONTOURS: Softly lifted, youthful facial contours; a clean, smooth
   jaw-to-neck line with no double chin.
5. HARMONY RULE: blend every adjustment into ONE natural, harmonious
   face — the "expensive photoshop" look where everything is clearly
   enhanced but nothing looks warped, stretched, or uncanny.
SKIN — flawless glass skin:
- Poreless-smooth, even-toned, luminous glass skin with a dewy glow —
  top-tier beauty retouching plus perfect flattering light.
- Completely remove blemishes, acne, redness, dark circles, and oiliness.
- Keep it ALIVE: soft highlights on the cheekbones and nose bridge, a
  healthy warm undertone — never plastic, waxy, or flat.
- Zero moles, zero spots, zero marks interrupting the flawless skin —
  every blemish, mole, spot, and scar completely covered and erased.
- The direction is one-way: marks may only be REMOVED, never added — do
  not paint any new mole, freckle, beauty mark, or spot anywhere, under
  any circumstance.
BEAUTY DIRECTION — modern Korean, youthful:
- Beautify in the aesthetic of TODAY's young Korean celebrities — fresh,
  youthful, clean. They must look subtly YOUNGER than the input photo,
  never older.
- AIM HIGH: the finished face should read like the stunning visual
  center of a top idol group — the kind of face that stops the scroll —
  while still being unmistakably this same person.
- Woman: dewy "no-makeup makeup" base with a soft natural accent — soft
  natural straight brows, delicate eye makeup, a gentle rosy lip. Never
  heavy or dramatic.
- Man: clean K-drama actor grooming — neat natural brows, fresh clear
  skin, effortless and modern.
- Hair: a trendy modern Korean hairstyle that suits them, in their true
  hair color, styled beautifully for the scene (around the glasses
  naturally if they wear them). Never a dated style that ages them.
RELIGHT COMPLETELY (this makes it look real):
- Discard the lighting of the original photo entirely. Re-light the face
  and body with the flattering key light described in the scene below,
  with a gentle rim light in the hair and natural soft shadows. They must
  look truly photographed in this place at this moment — and the face
  must always stay BRIGHT and luminous.
THE SCENE — personal color pictorial (the color is chosen FOR them):
- STEP: first, judge from the person's skin undertone, hair, and eye
  color which seasonal color palette flatters them most — warm spring
  (fresh corals, warm ivory), cool summer (soft rose, misty lavender),
  warm autumn (rich camel, brick, olive), or cool winter (crisp navy,
  true red, icy white). Commit fully to the ONE palette that makes their
  face glow.
- Then build the entire pictorial around that palette: wardrobe in the
  palette's most flattering tones (a refined knit, blouse, or jacket
  with a clean fit around the neckline), a seamless studio backdrop in
  a harmonious tone from the same palette, and subtle styling accents.
- Light: flawless beauty lighting on the person — a bright soft key
  light with delicate catchlights, gentle fill, and a clean rim light,
  clearly BEAUTIFYING, idol-grade luminous, the face glowing noticeably
  brighter and prettier than everything around it, every feature crisp —
  while the whole frame reads as one harmonious color story; an elegant,
  polished beauty-editorial mood.
- The effect must be unmistakable: "this color was MADE for them" —
  skin looking clearer, brighter, and healthier because the palette
  fits. No readable text anywhere.
POSE — a poised editorial pose: relaxed shoulders, gentle confident
gaze toward the camera.
FRAMING — vertical 3:4 portrait, upper-body shot, the person centered —
tall, model-like proportions with the small refined face clearly the
hero of the frame.
CAMERA — shot on an 85mm portrait lens at f/1.8: the person tack-sharp,
the background melting into soft creamy bokeh. Bright, clean, film-like
color grade. Photorealistic, high resolution.
FINAL SELF-CHECK before output:
- Next to the source photo, friends must instantly say "that's the same
  person — and this is the best they have ever looked."
- Is the enhancement CLEARLY visible — face obviously smaller, brighter,
  and prettier than the input? A timid result is a failure.
- Never warped or uncanny?
- SKIN CHECK: flawless glass skin with zero moles, zero spots, zero
  INVENTED marks anywhere?
- Glasses exactly as the source? Hair color true to the source?
ABSOLUTELY AVOID:
- A timid, under-retouched result that barely improves on the source.
- Removing the person's glasses if they wore them, adding glasses they
  didn't wear, or duplicating any eyewear. No sunglasses.
- A warped, over-liquified, or uncanny face — enhancements must read as
  expensive photoshop, never distortion.
- Making them unrecognizable or turning them into a generic pretty person.
- ANY aged, mature, or old-fashioned look — never older than the input.
- Any painted-on or INVENTED mole, spot, or mark.
- Plastic waxy skin, dead flat lighting, murky shadows on the face,
  oversaturated HDR.
- A clashing or unflattering palette that dulls the skin.
- Crowds or other people in the background.
- Any readable text, signs, or watermarks anywhere.
Output: one photorealistic photo — the same person in a complete
personal-color pictorial portrait, at the absolute best of their life.
High resolution, no text, no watermark, no border.`;
